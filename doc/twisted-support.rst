Twisted support
===============

testtools provides support for running Twisted tests â€“ tests that return a
Deferred_ and rely on the Twisted reactor.

You should not use this feature right now. We reserve the right to change the
API and behaviour without telling you first.

However, if you are going to, here's how you do it::

  from testtools import TestCase
  from testtools.deferredruntest import AsynchronousDeferredRunTest

  class MyTwistedTests(TestCase):

      run_tests_with = AsynchronousDeferredRunTest

      def test_foo(self):
          # ...
          return d

In particular, note that you do *not* have to use a special base ``TestCase``
in order to run Twisted tests.

You can also run individual tests within a test case class using the Twisted
test runner::

   class MyTestsSomeOfWhichAreTwisted(TestCase):

       def test_normal(self):
           pass

       @run_test_with(AsynchronousDeferredRunTest)
       def test_twisted(self):
           # ...
           return d

Here are some tips for converting your Trial tests into testtools tests.

* Use the ``AsynchronousDeferredRunTest`` runner
* Make sure to upcall to ``setUp`` and ``tearDown``
* Don't use ``setUpClass`` or ``tearDownClass``
* Don't expect setting .todo, .timeout or .skip attributes to do anything
* ``flushLoggedErrors`` is ``testtools.deferredruntest.flush_logged_errors``
* ``assertFailure`` is ``testtools.deferredruntest.assert_fails_with``
* Trial spins the reactor a couple of times before cleaning it up,
  ``AsynchronousDeferredRunTest`` does not.  If you rely on this behavior, use
  ``AsynchronousDeferredRunTestForBrokenTwisted``.
