==================================
Notes for contributing to pyunit3k
==================================

Coding style
------------

In general, follow PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>.

For consistency with the standard library's ``unittest`` module, method names
are generally ``camelCase``.

pyunit3k supports Python 2.4 and later, so avoid any 2.5-only features like
the ``with`` statement.


Copyright assignment
--------------------

Currently all code in pyunit3k is copyright Jonathan M. Lange.  For the sake
of licensing simplicity, copyright of contributed code needs to be assigned to
Jonathan M. Lange otherwise it cannot be accepted.  Please include an
appropriate statement of copyright assignment with contributions.


Testing
-------

Please write tests for every feature.  This project ought to be a model
example of well-tested Python code!

Take particular care to make sure the *intent* of each test is clear.

You can run tests with ``make check``, or by running ``./run-tests`` directly.


Source layout
-------------

The top-level directory contains the ``pyunit3k/`` package directory, and
miscellaneous files like README and setup.py.

The ``pyunit3k/`` directory is the Python package itself.  It is separated
into submodules for internal clarity, but all public APIs should be “promoted”
into the top-level package by importing them in ``pyunit3k/__init__.py``.
Users of pyunit3k should never import a submodule, they are just
implementation details.

Tests belong in ``pyunit3k/tests/``.
